<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

A Blockchain-based Decentralized Identity Management (DID) system enables individuals to own and control their identities without relying on a central authority.

To build a simple implementation of a basic DID system, we can use blockchain technology to store identity-related information, ensuring transparency, security, and privacy.

We'll use hashlib for cryptographic hashing and json for storing identity data
and ed25519 elliptic curve signature cryptographic algorithm, which is known for its security, efficiency, and faster operations.


Key Components:
* Blockchain: A basic blockchain structure that stores identity information in blocks.
* Identity Management: An identity will be associated with a DID and stored in the blockchain.
* Public/Private Key: The DID will use asymmetric encryption (public/private key pairs) for managing identity-related actions securely.

Notes:

Security Considerations: This is a simplified implementation for demonstration purposes. In a real-world system, additional features like secure key storage, encryption, and more robust identity verification mechanisms would be required.

Scalability: This example uses a simple blockchain. For production systems, you would want to use a more advanced and scalable solution, such as Ethereum or Hyperledger Indy, which provide specialized DID frameworks.

Signature Generation: The signature verification here is a placeholder, as generating and verifying RSA signatures requires using the private key to sign messages and the public key to verify them.

This implementation provides a foundation for understanding how a decentralized identity management system works using blockchain, but it would need further expansion for use in a real-world scenario.

### Built With Python 3.13

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This example requires Python 3.10 or higher version.

Install the ed25519 library using pip3 tool.

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Change git remote url to avoid accidental pushes to base project
   ```sh
   git remote set-url origin github_username/repo_name
   git remote -v # confirm the changes
   ```
